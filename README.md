# 🛡️ MUST - Mobile Urban Safety Tracker

It goes without saying that the world isn't the safest place to wonder around in alone. For many people, it is a daily concern as to whether or not they will make it home safely from their commute to and from work, the store, recreational events and so forth.
M.U.S.T provides a non-intrusive mobile application designed with safety in mind. 

## 🚄 Quick Start 

1. 🌳 Set up the environment.

  Download Node.js and NPM from the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone the repo to your computer.
  Navigate to the repos directory and install packages.

    ```shell
      cd MUST/
      npm install
    ```
  Install the expo client.

    ```shell
      npm i -g expo-cli
    ```

2. 📁 Start developing
  In the repos directory start up the project.

  ```shell
    npm start
  ```
  Download the Expo Go app for [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779).
  Use the app to connect to the project with the QR code or the server link.

3. 📋 Open the source code and start editing.
  Any changes made will be reflected real time to the expo app.
  
## 🧐 What's inside?

  A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in MUST.
    .
    ├── assets
    ├── components
    ├── pages
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── App.js
    ├── README.md
    ├── app.json
    ├── babel.config.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
    
  1.  **`/assets`**: This directory contains all of the images for the app.

  2.  **`/components`**: This directory will contain all of the code that can be reusable for pages.

  3.  **`pages`**: This directory holds all the layouts of the pages found in the app.

  4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

  5.  **`App.js`**: This file is  is the actual file where our gets compiled too. App.js is how we control page routes and components to use.

  6.  **`README.md`**: This file contains information about the project and how to get started.

  7.  **`app.json`**: This file contains information about our project, its name, its supported platforms, icon, splash images.

  8.  **`babel.config.js`**: This file is for configuring how babel works with this project and babel is just a compiler which allows us to use modern JavaScript features.

  9. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of the npm dependencies that were installed on MUST. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

  10. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for MUST.
